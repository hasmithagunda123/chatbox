User Interaction: Users type their questions or requests in the input field and click the "Send" button or press Enter.

Bot Response: The chatbot processes the user's message using advanced natural language processing algorithms and responds with helpful information.

Instant Feedback: Users receive instant feedback from the chatbot, which guides them through HR processes, policies, and more.

Gmail Integration: Users are encouraged to provide their Gmail address to receive follow-up information, updates, and notifications directly to their inbox.
